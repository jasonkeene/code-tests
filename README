    This repository is where I put any little projects that don't seem official enough to warrant their own repositories. The scripts here can range from a single function implementing an algorithm, a class implementing a data structure, or an entire game or program. The languages used vary from assembly to C/C++ to Python.

    I hope you can find a use for something here!
